  <h1>The Case At Hand</h1>
  <p>Local leader of Planned Parenthood, Griswold, and one of its doctors were arrested under a state level Comstock law</p>
  <p>Griswold loses once on local and then again on state level courts</p>
  <p>Appeals to Supreme Court</p>

  <h1>Griswold's Argument</h1>
  <p>Her 14th amendment rights had been violated when she was charged with the crime</p>
  <p>Whatever happened to due process?</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Arguing for Griswold</h1>
  <p>Amendments in use:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1st Amendment, right to assemble.</li>
    <li>3rd Amendment, consent before quartering soldiers.</li>
    <li>4th Amendment, right to security and privacy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Though these rights are not found explicitly in the constitution, There is a clear implication.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Penumbras and Implications</h1>
  <p>I think penumbra is perhaps the worst word to describe this.</p>
  <p>The reality is that the consitution is clearly predicated on philsophy not included within the document itself.</p>

<section>
  <h1>A Priori and Induction</h1>
  <p>What Justice Douglas meant by implication is induction.</p>
  <p>The 4th and 5th amendment are clearly arrived at from a philosophy that is protective of an individual's privacy.</p>
  <p>We are inducting the a priori of the consitution.</p>

  <h1>Dissenting Voices</h1>
  <p>Justice Harlan</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't look beyond law and infer a new right to privacy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Justice Black</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Refuse to read in a right of privacy that is not explicitly in the consitution.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>The Question is Philosophical</h1>
  <p>Is inducting the a priori of the consitution creating new laws?</p>
  <p>Or, do we already abide by natural law and written law is simply convenient instanstiations?</p>
